# 🍸Mixora
It's a playful web app that lets you discover cocktails from around the world — complete with ingredients, preparation steps, and a splash of style.
This project is built as a hands-on experiment to explore API integration and dynamic content rendering using a free public cocktail API.

🛠 Tech Stack

HTML5 – Structure and content

CSS3 – Styling and layout

Bootstrap 5 – Responsive design and components

JavaScript (Vanilla) – Logic and interactivity

Free Cocktail API – Fetching live cocktail data

⚙️ How It Works

The user searches for a cocktail or browses through a list.

On clicking a particular cocktail, the app fetches cocktail details (name, image, ingredients, preparation steps) from the CocktailDB API.

The results are dynamically displayed in a clean, responsive layout using Bootstrap styling.
